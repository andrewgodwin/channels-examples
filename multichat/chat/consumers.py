### WebSocket handling ###

# in all consumers with the same reply_channel, so all three here)

# of its own with a few attributes extra so we can route it
# This doesn't need @channel_session_user as the next consumer will have that,
# and we preserve message.reply_channel (which that's based on)
def ws_receive(message):
    # All WebSocket frames have either a text or binary payload; we decode the

### Chat channel handling ###


# Channel_session_user loads the user out from the channel session and presents

# a low-level HTTP handler, or just channel_session if all you want is the
# message.channel_session object without the auth fetching overhead.
